Sure, here's a summary of our conversation with the included code snippets:

1. Your Fedora 37 desktop was waking up immediately from suspend mode. To diagnose this, we first checked the system logs:

    ```bash
    journalctl -b -g 'suspend|wake'
    ```

2. You checked which devices were enabled to wake your system from suspend with:

    ```bash
    cat /proc/acpi/wakeup
    ```

3. You provided the output, which showed several devices (PEG1, PEG0, RP05, RP07, PXSX, XHCI, AWAC) that were enabled and potentially causing the wake-up.

4. I explained that these entries represent different system components and suggested you could disable these to isolate the problematic device. For example:

    ```bash
    echo "DEVICE_NAME" | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup
    ```
    
    device was XHCI (usb)

5. I clarified that disabling PCI slots for troubleshooting is typically safe and the changes are not permanent.

6. I explained the use of the `tee` command, which helps write to a file with root privileges by working around the restriction that prevents `sudo` from working with redirection (`>`).

7. You found that the XHCI (representing USB devices) was causing the wake-up. To identify the exact USB device, I suggested looking at system logs:

    ```bash
    dmesg | grep -i 'usb'
    ```

8. And cross-referencing the product and vendor IDs from these logs with the output of:

    ```bash
    lsusb
    ```

9. If the device is not intended to wake your system, you can control this by writing a 'disabled' attribute to the device's power/wakeup file:

    ```bash
    echo 'disabled' | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/usbX/power/wakeup
    ```

   where `usbX` is the USB bus the device is connected to. BIOS/UEFI settings may also allow configuration of what devices can wake up the machine.

By following these steps, you should be able to prevent your Fedora 37 desktop from waking up immediately after entering suspend mode.
