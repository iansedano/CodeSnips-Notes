# *Note*: focusDelay is only supported when compiled with the "EXPERIMENTAL_FOCUS_FIRST" flag.

# - pollMillis: How often to poll the mouse position and consider a raise/focus. Lower values increase responsiveness but also CPU load. Minimum = 20 and default = 50.
# - delay: Raise delay, specified in units of pollMillis. Disabled if 0. A delay > 1 requires the mouse to stop for a moment before raising.
# - focusDelay: Focus delay, specified in units of pollMillis. Disabled if 0. A delay > 1 requires the mouse to stop for a moment before focusing.
# - warpX: A Factor between 0 and 1. Makes the mouse jump horizontally to the activated window. By default disabled.
# - warpY: A Factor between 0 and 1. Makes the mouse jump vertically to the activated window. By default disabled.
# - scale: Enlarge the mouse for a short period of time after warping it. The default is 2.0. To disable set it to 1.0.
# - altTaskSwitcher: Set to true if you use 3rd party tools to switch between applications (other than standard command-tab).
# - ignoreSpaceChanged: Do not immediately raise/focus after a space change. The default is false.
# - invertIgnoreApps: Turns the ignoreApps parameter into an includeApps parameter. The default is false.
# - ignoreApps: Comma separated list of apps for which you would like to disable focus/raise.
# - ignoreTitles: Comma separated list of window titles (a title can be an ICU regular expression) for which you would like to disable focus/raise.
# - stayFocusedBundleIds: Comma separated list of app bundle identifiers that shouldn't lose focus even when hovering the mouse over another window.
# - disableKey: Set to control, option or disabled. This will temporarily disable AutoRaise while holding the specified key. The default is control.
# - mouseDelta: Requires the mouse to move a certain distance. 0.0 = most sensitive whereas higher values decrease sensitivity.
# - verbose: Set to true to make AutoRaise show a log of events when started in a terminal.
