A systemd service file is divided into sections, each starting with a tag in square brackets. Each section contains different directives (settings) for that service.

Say you had a `/etc/systemd/system/disable-wakeup.service` file with this first section:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Disable wakeup from certain devices
```

The `[Unit]` section is used to define metadata and dependencies. In this case, you only include a `Description` directive that provides a human-readable explanation of the service.

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo "DEVICE_NAME" > /proc/acpi/wakeup'
```

The `[Service]` section is used to define how the service behaves. In this case, you've only included an `ExecStart` directive that specifies the command to execute when the service starts.

- `/bin/bash -c '...'` is invoking the bash shell to execute the command contained in the quotes.

- `'echo "XHCI" > /proc/acpi/wakeup'` is the command being run by the bash shell.

```ini
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The `[Install]` section is used to define how the service is installed, which means when it should be started.

`WantedBy=multi-user.target` specifies that the service should be started when the system reaches the "multi-user" target, which is a standard system state where multiple users can log in and all network services are available.

Finally, to make the service take effect, you'd enable and start it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable disable-wakeup.service
sudo systemctl start disable-wakeup.service
```

This tells systemd to start the service at boot (enable), and to start it right now (start).
