Here's a progression of 10 dynamic programming problems, arranged in order of increasing complexity. These problems will help you deepen your understanding of various dynamic programming concepts and techniques:

1. **Climbing Stairs**: Given `n` steps, count how many distinct ways you can climb to the top if you can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.

2. **House Robber**: Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police (you cannot rob two adjacent houses).

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

4. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of `n` items, put these items in a knapsack of a fixed capacity to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

5. **Coin Change 2 (Total Ways to Make Change)**: For a given amount and coin denominations, count all the different ways to make that amount with the given coins.

6. **Word Break Problem**: Given a non-empty string and a dictionary containing a list of non-empty words, determine if the string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

7. **Maximum Subarray (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm)**: Find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.

8. **Edit Distance**: Given two strings, compute the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other (operations are insertions, deletions, or substitutions of a single character).

9. **Longest Common Subsequence**: Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them.

10. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together in terms of minimizing the number of scalar multiplications.

These problems cover a range of dynamic programming techniques, including memoization, bottom-up tabulation, handling two-dimensional DP arrays, and dealing with string manipulation. As you progress through these problems, you'll encounter increasingly complex state representations and transition functions, which are key to mastering dynamic programming.
