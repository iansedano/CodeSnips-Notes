JavaScript, is mostly for building user interfaces. You need to envisage the interface, what the user will be faced with, to be able to build anything with purpose. The more you can empathize with the user, the more you can live in their shoes, the more focused your development becomes.

JavaScript is often lumped in with the front-end. Though the back/front end distinction is a very crude one. If design was the only aspect necessary for a UI, then why would you need engineers to build one? 

UIs actually have a huge influence over the architecture and can define the architecture. After all, if the user doesn't use it and love it, what chance does it have at surviving.

A UI should be intuitive and discoverable.

Though outside the scope of this course, but here we could even be talking about a moral decision for you to make. The main drive of most social media sites, and most entertainment is to keep your attention. Is it right to try and command attention above all else, since that is what pays in the short term? Or should you be providing value to the user, even though it may not be the most lucrative option in the short term, which is why the users give attention willingly? This is a very loaded philosophical discussion which unfortunately cannot be gone into further here, but is maybe some food for thought as you think about what your style of development will be.
