REST stands for Representational State Transfer

it is an architectural style

REST provides a definition of a "resource"

---

"we need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff
that is on all other machines. We need a way of having one machine
tell another machine about a resource that may be on yet another
machine."


POLYMORPHISM - a way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them.

i.e. get the paper, the shopping...

machines don't automatically know that we can use the same 'method'
on all the things...


many assume HTTP is just for getting stuff, but its a general purpose
protocol to assign verbs to nouns, or methods to resources.

URLs are universally understandable nouns

And the HTTP methods are like universally understandable verbs
