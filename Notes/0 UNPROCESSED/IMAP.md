[RFC 3501](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501)

IMAP is for you to treat your emails in folders

Messages are accessed by the use of numbers, either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers

Assumes a reliable data stream such as TCP. If on TCP, listens on port 143(clear text)  or port 993(SSL)

A connection consists of the establishment of a client/server network connection, initial greeting from server, then further interactions.

All communications are in the form of lines that end with CLRF

Client command begins an operation. Each client command prefixed with an identifier (usually something like A0001) called a "tag". A different tag is generated by the client for each command.

IMAP is only to retrieve mail, not to send. For sending usually SMTP post.
