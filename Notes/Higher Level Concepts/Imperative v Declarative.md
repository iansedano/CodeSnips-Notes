When you inspect react code, its almost like seeing it on the page. You give instructions to say how things should look.

Whereas with imperative programming its more step by step, its more like "traditional programming" . Take the first element, create a new element, add a class, then append it to the first element.

In React, you say, you should have two elements that look like so.

Vanilla JS and JQuery are heavy in imperative, they have many tools that help with this. This is kind of how computers run...React JSX eventually becomes imperative instructions. But the way the Developer interacts with it is very different.

Declarative needs solid state management??

If you are going to react, then you kind of need to forget about direct DOM manipulation.


Imperative - C, C++, Java
Declarative - SQL, HTML
Mix - JS, C#, Python


In declarative, you say, this is the result I want. Executive Manager.
In imperative, you say, do this, then that, then that. Micromanager.
