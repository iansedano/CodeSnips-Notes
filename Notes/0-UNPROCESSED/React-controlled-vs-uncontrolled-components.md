When making forms, you can follow the general React way, which is to control everything through props and state. This is what is meant by using controlled components.

With uncontrolled components, it means that instead of using React state to manage all the visual updates of the form, it makes use of the DOM itself, which is usually exactly against the whole React way of thinking, though for some cases its fine.
